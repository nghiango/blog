This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Command

Build and deploy to github:

```bash
npm run build:stg
```
This command will build all source and put in the docs folder, then it will automatically push on github.
