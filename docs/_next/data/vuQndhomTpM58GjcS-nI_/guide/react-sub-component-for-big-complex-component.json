But this way doesn't show the \nrelationship when we are using them in the other place. Therefore, to boost the relationship and speed up the development.\nWe can use sub-component to show the relationship between components.\n\n## What is sub-component\nSub-component is a child component that can be call by Parent component.\nFor example, we have a `Card` component, and we want to use `Header`, `Body`, `Footer` in `Card` component.\nWe can create `Header`, `Body`, `Footer` as sub-component of `Card` component.\nThen we export them inside `Card` component, and access them by `Card.Header`, `Card.Body`, `Card.Footer`.\n\n# How to create sub-component\n\n\n# Reference\nhttps://dev.to/devsatasurion/the-best-way-to-build-big-react-components-5295\nhttps://www.skovy.dev/blog/using-component-dot-notation-with-typescript-to-create-a-set-of-components?seed=i30o5s\nhttps://dev.to/hey_yogini/create-react-subcomponents-in-a-simple-way-5h1f"},"__N_SSG":true}
